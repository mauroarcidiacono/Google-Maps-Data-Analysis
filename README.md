# Google-Maps-Data-Analysis

This is the final project of the Visualization Tools Module of the Big Data Advanced Certificate at ITBA. I decided to use R, Tableau and a script from observablehq.

Part of this work was done based on the code that Sa√∫l Buentello posted in a [Medium article](https://medium.com/geekculture/explore-your-activity-on-google-with-r-how-to-analyze-and-visualize-your-location-history-2ea8edabe733). His code can be found in the following [repository](https://github.com/cosmoduende/r-google-location-history).
